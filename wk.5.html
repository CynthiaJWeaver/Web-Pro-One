<h1>Welcome to Western Wall School of the Supernatural</h1>
<h2>Please enter responses on this form to have your child included on our waitlist.</h2>

    
    
 <!--   The form should ask for relevant demographic information, name, age, gender, upcoming grade, and a drop down selector for which school you want your child to be on the waiting list. 

There should be buttons, at least 3, for different schools, for instance Liberty Middle School, TCMS, but add other schools. 

Each button should have an event handler (for instance, <input type="button" name="button" onclick=" info_TCMS()" value="info on TCMS"/> ) which will call a function to provide the parent with some information about the school, and advice on getting into that school (an extremely simple, but not elegant means would be an alert), so that the parent can get info on the school before submitting the form. 

The form should css styled in an attractive manner, via a linked to css file (of your own creation)  or with Bootstrap.

Please comment your code.
