                <h2>English Language Arts Grades 6-8</h2>
                In grades 6-8, analysis and writing are the primary foci. Rhetoric is introduced in 6th grade. In this
                grade band, students go from explaining theme to analyzing it. Students progress from examining character
                perspective to working with complex narrator types. Students are also being introduced to literature
                from historic time periods. This framework should help students in building a body of knowledge useful in
                being able to interpret multiple layers of meaning.
